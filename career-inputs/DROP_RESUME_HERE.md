# Drop Your Career Materials Here

Put any of the following into this folder. Claude Code will find and read them automatically during setup.

## Required

- **Your resume** — PDF, DOCX, or plain text. This is the single most important input. Claude reads it to understand your experience, skills, and career trajectory so you don't have to retype everything from memory.

## Optional (but helpful)

- **Cover letters** — past cover letters help Claude understand how you talk about yourself
- **Performance reviews** — gives context on your strengths and accomplishments
- **Project summaries** — descriptions of major projects, launches, or initiatives
- **Career notes** — screenshots of achievements, awards, certifications, anything relevant

## What happens with these files

- Claude Code scans this folder during setup and reads what it finds
- Your profile is built from these materials + a short conversation
- **Nothing leaves your machine** — all files are gitignored and stay local

## File formats

Any of these work: `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.doc`, `.txt`, `.md`, `.rtf`

Just drop them in and run `claude`. It handles the rest.
